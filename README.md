Welcome to the **Cross-Platform Powerful C2**! This tool is designed for exploitation and post-exploration in red team attacks, leveraging the HTTP protocol for communication.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

This tool is written and intended **only for educational purposes** or for use in **legally and ethically conducted penetration testing**. Unauthorized use of this tool is strictly prohibited and may be illegal.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Session Management**: Handle multiple sessions simultaneously, allowing for efficient control over numerous targets.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring broad usability.
- **Custom Command Adding**: Easily add custom commands to tailor the tool to specific needs and scenarios.
- **Additional Commands and Functions**: Equipped with a variety of built-in commands and functions to enhance exploitation and post-exploitation activities.
- **HTTP-Based Communication**: Utilizes HTTP for command and control, ensuring it works virtually anywhere with internet access.
- **Firewall/IDS/IPS Evasion**: The tool's traffic mimics that of a library website, helping it avoid detection by firewalls, IDS, and IPS.
- **Persistent Operation**: Designed to run indefinitely; if the client goes down, it will attempt to restart itself on the target machine.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Implemented with secure coding practices to avoid code hijacking, especially useful in CTF games.
